# NPM Dependents by downloads

A script that sorts by weekly downloads the dependents of a package. It's useful when you want to find popular packages that use a dependency to get usage ideas or good practices.

## Install

`npm install -g scrape-npm-dependents`

## Usage

`snd --package theme-ui` or `snd --help`

The script stops if the dependents are more than 300.
